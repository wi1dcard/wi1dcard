Was born in the late 90s, dropped out of school in 2015, have been into software development for over 6 years. I'm:

- A thinker, but rather doing than planning too far beforehand;
- A practitioner, driven by interests mostly, enjoy trying things different or haven't ever been done by others;
- A team player, like to collaborate effectively and provide help to people, except those who don't google first;
- A developer, feeling accomplishment when designed components work smoothly as expected;
- And an [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality).

I usually work in my own rhythm, don't like being interrupted when concentrating on something, and often live in an American-Chinese mixed lifestyle.
