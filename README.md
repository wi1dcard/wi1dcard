Was born in the late 90s, dropped out of school in 2015, and have been into software development for over 8 years.

I'm:

- A thinker, but rather doing than planning too far beforehand;
- A practitioner, driven by interests mostly, enjoy trying different things;
- A team player, like to collaborate effectively and provide help, except those who don't google first;
- And an [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality).
